# MMA Prediction Anslysis

## Result

#### 70% Accuracy

We were able to achieve 70% accuracy which is very high for MMA prediction thanks to feature engineering and Deep Learning

## Process

* I webscraped every fight and fighter in UFC history into two datasets and then cleaned the data
* In joined the two datasets together with every fight with all the fighters information
* next I found the difference in their height, reach, record, age, etc. to put them into a neural network
* Made a neural network that took their differences in and who won to predict the winner

## What I would do Better

* Add more variables to it like type of Martial Arts, injuries, etc.
* Removing outliers such as outliers to better fit the model
* Make it INTERACTIVE to be used

## Inspiration

I love Martial Arts. I am a second degree black belt or E Dan in Tang Soo Do, registered under the offical Korean Federation for over 14 years now, so I wanted to incorporate my love for martial arts into a project for data science.
